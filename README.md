Welcome to the ISLa-Reinforcement Learning (RL) Playground!ðŸš€ A Framework developed for the RL course at the University of Verona designed to help students familiarize and test their own implementations of advanced state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: We provide extensive documentation to guide students through the framework, including setup instructions, examples, and explanations of key concepts.

- **Easy-to-Use Access**: The framework is designed to be user-friendly, allowing students to quickly experiment with various RL algorithms.

- **Integration with Wandb**: We offer seamless integration with [Weights & Biases (wandb)](https://wandb.ai/) for logging and visualizing experiment results. Students can easily track their training progress and compare different algorithms using the wandb dashboard.

- **Local Plotting**: In addition to wandb, students can also choose to plot their results locally using popular Python libraries such as seaborn and matplotlib on their own PCs. This provides flexibility and ensures that students can visualize their results even without an internet connection.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and follow the setup instructions provided in the documentation to install the framework and its dependencies.

2. **Experimentation**: Explore the examples and templates provided to understand how to define environments, implement algorithms, and train agents using the framework.

3. **Logging with Wandb**: To use wandb for experiment logging, sign up for an account on the wandb website and obtain your API key. Then, follow the instructions in the documentation to set up wandb integration and start logging your experiments.

4. **Local Plotting**: If you prefer to plot your results locally, follow the instructions in the documentation to use seaborn and matplotlib for visualizing training curves, episode rewards, and other metrics.

5. **Customization**: Experiment with different RL algorithms, tweak hyperparameters, and modify the framework to suit your project needs.

Happy Reinforcement Learning!
